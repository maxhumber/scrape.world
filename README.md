Welcome to amazing project [Scrape World](https://scrape.world)!

A web scraping sandbox; a website that was designed to be scraped.

[here Solutions available](https://github.com/maxhumber/scrape.world/tree/master/solutions).

Scrape World is deployed with Dokku ([guide](https://github.com/maxhumber/scrape.world/blob/master/deploy_dokku.md))

If, for some reason (ðŸ’¸), this website is taken down:

1. Clone this repo
2. cd into `scrape.world`
3. Run `python app.py` to spin up a development server
4. Change URL from `https://scrape.world/<page>` to `http://localhost:5000/<page>`

Happy scraping!
